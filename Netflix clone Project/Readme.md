# Netflix Clone 
The Netflix Clone Project is a web-based application created using HTML and CSS to replicate the user interface of the popular streaming platform, Netflix. The project focuses on mimicking the look and feel of Netflix's homepage, including features like a navigation bar, movie thumbnails, a hero section for featured content, and various sections for different genres. The design is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices. This project is an excellent exercise in front-end development, showcasing skills in layout design, styling, and responsive web design.
